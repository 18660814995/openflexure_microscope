# OpenFlexure Microscope STL Files
tl;dr **don't print these files if you want a microscope!** Please go to [docs/stl](../docs/stl/) for the files, and check the readme in that folder.  If you want the bleeding-edge version, you are better off using the automatically built version - either from [builds](../builds/) or by downloading the repository and building it yourself.

This folder is for built STL files.  It's possible I should have excluded these from the repo, as they are build products - but it's often handy to have them here.  *Please don't just print this folder* as it does not add up to a full microscope!  The instructions on Docubricks describe what you need.  By all means use the up-to-date files from here rather than the STLs included there, but bear in mind that assembly might change from version to version.

I'm working on an automated build process that will make this all much cleaner - but it is as yet pretty basic.  Currently the output from that goes in builds/.  That directory is likely more current than the docs folder, which is intended to match the assembly instructions.
