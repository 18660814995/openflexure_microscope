# OpenFlexure Microscope STL Files
This folder is for built STL files.  It's possible I should have excluded these from the repo, as they are build products - but it's often handy to have them here.  *Please don't just print this folder* as it does not add up to a full microscope!  The instructions on Docubricks describe what you need.  By all means use the up-to-date files from here rather than the STLs included there, but bear in mind that assembly might change from version to version.

I'm working on an automated build process that will make this all much cleaner - but it's not done yet!
