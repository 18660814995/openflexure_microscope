  "body": "## 3D Printed Microscopes!\r\nThis project has been going for a couple of years now, aiming to make a microscope that not only has high-magnification optics but also a really good mechanical stage.  Development is ongoing, but it's quite well optimised already, with a [study on its mechanical performance](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068) and a [stable release](http://www.docubricks.com/projects/openflexure-microscope).  This site is a little sparse at present, but the repository now has all the source files for the microscope.\r\n\r\n## Buy a Kit!\r\nIf you're in the UK, we'd love to sell you a kit - head over to [WaterScope](http://www.waterscope.org/) to pre-order one.\r\n\r\n## Projects based on OpenFlexure Microscope\r\nThis design has been used in lots of different places, from labs to schools - but one initiative I'm very keen to support is [WaterScope](http://www.waterscope.org), a not for profit start-up aiming to make testing for bacterial contamination much faster, cheaper, and easier to use.\r\n",
