<p>This project has been going for a couple of years now, aiming to make a microscope that not only has high-magnification optics but also a really good mechanical stage.  Development is ongoing, but it's quite well optimised already, with a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068">study on its mechanical performance</a> and a <a href="http://www.docubricks.com/projects/openflexure-microscope">first stable release on DocuBricks</a>.  This site is a little sparse at present, but the repository now has all the source files for the microscope.</p>
<p>If you'd like to build one yourself, it's best to download a <a href="https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/releases/">release</a> rather than just heading to the STL folder in the repository, because there's no guarantee the STL files in there will be up to date and there will be a large number of duplicate parts.  There is full documentation with lots of photos included in the zip download in <a href="http://www.docubricks.com/">DocuBricks</a> format, but thanks to <a href="http://www.waterscope.org/">WaterScope</a> and <a href="http://www.red-gate.com">Redgate</a> we also have a rewritten set of <a href="http://www.waterscope.org/instructions/">assembly instructions</a>.  Currently all the documentation and releases focus on the "basic" version of the microscope (i.e. a Raspberry Pi camera, using the lens from the camera module as the microscope objective).  It's possible to put it together with other options, including a motorised stage and an RMS objective, and I'm working on documenting that.</p>

<p>If you're in the UK, we'd love to sell you a kit - head over to <a href="http://www.waterscope.org/">WaterScope</a> to order one.  Stock is usually quite low as WaterScope is focussing on R&amp;D at the moment - but if you send an email, we'll usually be able to add some.</p>

<p>This design has been used in lots of different places, from labs to schools - but one initiative I'm very keen to support is <a href="http://www.waterscope.org">WaterScope</a>, a not for profit start-up aiming to make testing for bacterial contamination much faster, cheaper, and easier to use.  The translation stage also found its way into an <a href="http://cdt.sensors.cam.ac.uk/news/team-project-optical-projection-tomography">Optical Projection Tomography</a> system built by a student team at Cambridge.  It was initially funded through a <a href="http://www.synbio.cam.ac.uk/synbiofund/3D_printed_microscope">Cambridge SynBioFund project</a>, and has also been supported by the <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk">EPSRC</a>.</p>
