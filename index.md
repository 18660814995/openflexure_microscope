# OpenFlexure Microscope
The OpenFlexure Microscope is a  3D printable microscope, including a precise mechanical stage to move the sample and focus the optics.  There are many different options for the optics, ranging from a webcam lens to a 100x, oil immersion objective.

The trick of making a microscope out of a webcam has been around for a little while, and produces good results.  However, getting a nice mechanical stage to focus the microscope and move around on the sample is tricky.  This project is a 3D printable design that enables very fine (sub-micron) mechanical positioning of the sample and the lens, with surprisingly good mechanical stability.  It's discussed in various [media articles](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/wiki/Media-Articles) and a [paper in Review of Scientific Instruments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068) (open access).

# Documentation
The [build instructions](./docs/) are viewable on this website - the corresponding STL files are available from the [builds folder](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/tree/master/builds/) for now, though we will be migrating to a proper build server very soon.
