# piscope
3D Printable microscope from the University of Cambridge

This repository holds my OpenSCAD designs for a 3 axis flexure stage and microscope.  It's a 
remarkably nice little mechanism with high accuracy and low drift.  You can read all about it
here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05394

With apologies for not having put it into Git until version 5.11, this should now be the 
canonical place for said little microscope, and I'll now be able to make branches for fun
versions like the large stage version.  There's a step by step assembly guide with lots and 
lots of photos in the zip file release, along with the STL files.
